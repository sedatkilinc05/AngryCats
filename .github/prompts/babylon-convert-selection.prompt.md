description: 'Convert To Babylon Toolkit Script'
---
Your goal is to convert Unity C# code to babylon tookit based typescript

* Create new typescript (.ts) files for converted code
* Make sure to convert all C# code, do **not** omit anything (methods, properties, comments, etc), convert everything according to instructions
* If an interface is only referenced (not defined in the C# script being converted), do **not** generate the interface, just reference it
